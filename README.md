<h1> 02.07.2022 Edit Notes;</h1>
<h2>Before update; </h2>
1)Whole section update itself every second. </br>
2)Because i code like body.innerHTML = `everthing`.
<h2> After update;</h2>
1)I code just a changeble sections and i split them with spans. </br>
2)With this just Second section updating every second, </br>  - Minute secton wait seconds to 00 and hour wait Minute section to 00. </br>
3)Its seems using more and more less source.
